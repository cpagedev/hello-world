# hello-world
code basis and foundation, learning git and the github interface.

Hey Everyone, 

As I spent the past few weeks attempting to learn the programming language RUBY...here's what it came down to multiplied a few times by different sources: 
“Work through our lessons, and you’ll be ready to work as a professional developer!”
What actually happened?

I worked through the first few lessons, which all re-hash the same material I've seen over and over. Syntax, numbers, functions, methods, arrays, hashes, if statements, loops...eventually I moved beyond the same-as-everywhere-else introductory material and on to something new. And it makes sense! For a while…

Then I get to a lesson that has me stumped. It was a regular expression, or in this case some metaprogramming, then again in testing. The lesson talks about things you’ve already learned… but I couldnt remember. What I am trying to say, is as fresh and green as I could possibly be, I am not nearly this stupid? Or am I...I sense a sea of newbies going through the same wishy-washy tide of ebb and flow pushing themselves to the point of mental exhaustion, just to come up short when it comes to application. 

The barb will sink faster then the boat if it has enough passion on the end of the line...So it came to be, that I threw my hands up in this AHA! moment. I created a github account because what I need is real-absolute application, so-much-so a profile or portfolio to showcase my learning. Thousands of hours and lines of code on interactive lesson driven tutorials and videos doesn't help feed the family because there is no open-source repository or project that I could commit too. 

For what I've read the goal always seems to circle around "when you learn to code, pick something you can beleieve in." ANYTHING! I'm sorry to say, but I have no &^$!$#^ clue what this coding stuff is capable of, or how to solve problems like a coder to begin with. So I needed ideas, real world problems solved by syntax. I need examples of those, and I found that GitHub is this elusive magical place that bridges all of these tiny islands together.

Here's day one!
